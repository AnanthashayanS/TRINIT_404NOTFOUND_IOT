To Design a driver assistance system that reminds drivers to follow eco-driving principles for energy-efficient driving  through reminders when eco-driving principles are violated.

Vehicles play a significant role in the overall energy demand and emissions, making them a
significant contributor to sustainability issues in cities. To address this, it is crucial to reduce
the energy consumed by automobiles, and one way to do this is through eco-driving.

Eco-driving is the practice of driving vehicles in an energy-efficient manner, where drivers
follow specific principles to minimize energy consumption. The driver assistance system
proposed in this problem statement is designed to remind drivers to adhere to eco-driving
principles by alerting them when a principle is violated.

The goal of this system is to promote sustainable and eco-friendly driving practices, thereby
reducing energy consumption and emissions. The system will be a valuable tool for drivers,
as it will not only help them reduce their carbon footprint but also increase fuel efficiency
and lower their operating costs.

In conclusion, the driver assistance system for eco-driving is an innovative solution to a
pressing sustainability issue, and it has the potential to make a significant impact on the
environment and the economy.
