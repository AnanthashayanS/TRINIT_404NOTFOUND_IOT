Python Model Deployment for Eco Driving and Driver Assistance

>>>Python code is an effective solution for promoting eco driving and assisting drivers on the road. 
   The code is built using a range of essential libraries that are installed using the pip command.

>>>The user-defined function monitors critical parameters of the vehicle such as cruise speed, acceleration, 
   idling time, breaking count, and obstacle detection. 
   This information is crucial in promoting eco driving as it helps drivers to make informed decisions about
   their driving behavior.

>>>A unique machine learning model, which is based on linear regression, is used to determine the amount of 
   fuel required for a trip. 
   This model uses the latitude and longitude of the vehicle's location to make its predictions. 
   The data is trained using regression algorithms, and the model's precision and accuracy are attached in 
   the folder for reference.

>>>To implement the code in real-time, data from sensors is obtained from Firebase by acquiring the API key 
   and server IDs. 
   This data is then employed in the machine learning model, and the results are sent to the Thingspeak dashboard 
   for monitoring and analysis.

>>>In conclusion, this Python code provides a valuable tool for promoting eco driving and assisting drivers in 
   their journeys. 
   Its unique features and capabilities make it an excellent choice for any organization looking to optimize its 
   vehicle fleet.
